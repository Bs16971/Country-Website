            In England there is a lot of fashion, and it is so cool to see how it has grown through the ages. 
            If you would like to see how some of the most famous pieces of clothing were made go to the Dior museum, it shows a lot of his work and so many dresses.
            In central London, when it's colder, people always have long coats that are very beautiful. Since there are so many different cultures in England, you can find a lot of different styles.
